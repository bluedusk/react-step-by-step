# Intro

A collection of react demo projects.  

Often when we learning any react tutorial we are overwhelmed by tutorials which are either too completed or full featured. Its very hard for beginners to understand how to build an mordern react app from scratch.      
I'm trying to make this one easy to understand by making each branch only focus on one react feature, practice or third party library. And trying to answer and demo questions like: How react work with/without xyz library ?

Checkout branchs for more information.

# Branches

## React-00

Basic react crud demo with mocked data. No third party library used.

## React-00-Hooks

React-00 refactor with hooks.
